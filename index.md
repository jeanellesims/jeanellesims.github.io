My first webpage!
# This is a header
## This is a subheader  

I can make an unordered list
  * first bullet point
  * second bullet point
  * third bullet point
  
 I can also make an ordered list:
  1. first point
  2. second point
  3. third point

*this is italicized*

**this is bold**

I am going to add a figure here from the web:

![this is alt-text for this figure, corgi in a hat](https://uiuc-ischool-dataviz.github.io/spring2019online/week04/data/littleCorgiInHat.png)

I can also add in hyperlinks to places like [Google](https://www.google.com)

Add in a link to the photo I uploaded:
